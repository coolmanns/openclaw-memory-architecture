# Changelog

## v2.3 — Contemplation Pipeline + Metabolism Gap Extraction (2026-03-06)

### Contemplation Plugin (installed)
- Installed from `github.com/CoderofTheWest/openclaw-metacognitive-suite`
- Three-pass inquiry pipeline: explore (immediate) → reflect (4h) → synthesize (20h)
- LLM: Qwen3-30B via local llama.cpp (shared with metabolism)
- Heartbeat-driven pass execution (no nightshift dependency)
- Growth vectors output to `memory/growth-vectors.json` for crystallization

### Metabolism → Contemplation Pipeline (fixed)
- **Bug:** Metabolism extracted gaps but never forwarded them — `gapListeners.forEach()` call was missing from `index.js`
- **Bug:** Gap detection used regex on declarative implications — only 2 matches in 2,900+ candidates
- **Bug:** Conversation extractor entropy threshold (0.5) too high for typical sessions (0.15-0.30)
- **Fix:** Added `GAPS:` section to metabolism LLM prompt — explicit knowledge gap extraction as questions
- **Fix:** Added `GAPS:` parsing in `_parseGatedResponse()` with regex `_extractGaps()` fallback
- **Fix:** Wired `gapListeners.forEach()` in metabolism `index.js` after `processBatch()`
- **Validated:** 3 candidates → 6 gaps extracted, first contemplation inquiry queued

### Metabolism Quality (Task #97)
- `_stripMetadata()` — strips CONTINUITY/STABILITY context blocks before LLM processing
- `_normalizeEntity()` — resolves aliases from facts.db (e.g., "Sascha" → "Sascha Kuhlmann")
- `_inferRelationCategory()` — derives category from predicate instead of hardcoding 'person'
- Entity normalization wired into facts and relations parsing
- 18 tests covering metadata stripping, parsing, category inference, entity normalization

### Facts Cleanup
- 772 facts (up from ~500 pre-metabolism)
- 58 recategorized, 53 entity merges, 2 dupes deleted
- Category caps raised: person 125, project 175, infrastructure 150, family 125

### Metacognitive Stack Status
Running 4/7 CoderofTheWest plugins: stability, continuity, metabolism, contemplation. Graph installed (untracked). Nightshift skipped (using cron). Crystallization next (Task #92, after contemplation proven).

## v2.2 — Single-DB Consolidation + Category Taxonomy (2026-03-05)

### Breaking: Single facts.db
- **Consolidated dual-DB to single DB** at `~/.openclaw/data/facts.db`
- Old workspace path (`~/clawd/memory/facts.db`) eliminated
- Continuity's `facts-searcher.js` repointed to core DB (default path change)
- Metabolism's `insert-facts.py` repointed to core DB
- `insert-facts.js` was already repointed on 2026-03-04
- Rationale: dual-DB caused split-brain — writes went to one, reads from another

### Category Taxonomy (14 categories, enforced)
- **New categories:** `family`, `friend` (split from `person`)
- **Removed:** `people` (duplicate of `person`), `operational` (too vague), `fact` (catch-all), `facts-db` (meta noise), `category` (meta noise), `concept` (too vague)
- **Final 14:** `person`, `family`, `friend`, `pet`, `psychedelic`, `reference`, `project`, `infrastructure`, `tool`, `decision`, `preference`, `convention`, `automation`, `workflow`
- Guardrail: `VALID_CATEGORIES` in `insert-facts.py` — metabolism cannot invent categories
- Migration: 91 facts → family, 13 → friend, 10 junk rows remapped/deleted

### Schema Updates
- `schema/facts.sql` updated to v3: includes `facts_changelog` table, enhanced `relations` with activation/decay, documented category taxonomy
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` updated for single-DB, 14 categories
- `docs/tuning-knobs.md` updated stable/transient category lists

### Cleanup
- Removed `plugin-continuity-fix/` (patches upstreamed)
- Removed `plugin-graph-memory/` (retired — replaced by integrated facts search in continuity)
- Removed `.DS_Store` files

---

## v8.0 — Benchmark Overhaul + Search Telemetry (2026-02-22)

### Benchmark

**Fixed:**
- Old benchmark (`memory-benchmark.py`) had 26/60 queries pointing at nonexistent files
- Root file fallback was matching stop words, inflating scores for irrelevant files
- QMD called via `search` (BM25-only) instead of `query` (hybrid with reranking)

**Added:**
- `scripts/production-benchmark.js` — tests all 5 production search systems
  - Continuity vec (semantic similarity over conversation history)
  - Continuity BM25 (FTS5 keyword search over exchanges)
  - File-vec (semantic search over 210+ indexed workspace files)
  - Facts DB (entity/alias resolution with Hebbian activation)
  - Root files (always-loaded workspace files)
- Keyword-based evaluation (checks for expected content, not file paths)
- Per-system contribution tracking

**Found:**
- vec0 virtual table JOIN bug (`v.rowid` → `v.id`) — vector search showed 0 results in benchmark but worked fine in production
- Production result: **60/60 (100%)** across all 7 categories

### Search Telemetry

**Added:**
- Per-system timing instrumentation in continuity plugin's `before_agent_start` hook
- `~/.openclaw/data/search-telemetry.db` — logs every search with system, latency, result count, top distance, facts methods
- `scripts/search-telemetry-report.sh` — SQLite report: per-system performance, hourly breakdown, slow queries, zero-result queries, facts method distribution

### Documentation
- `docs/2026-02-22-session-report.md` — full session write-up with findings and architecture insights

## v7.0 — Hebbian Integration + FileIndexer + facts.db Hygiene (2026-02-22)

### Hebbian Memory (facts.db → Runtime)
- Ported `graph-search.py` to Node.js as `facts-searcher.js` inside continuity plugin
- Hooked into `before_agent_start` — facts injected as "From your knowledge base:" block
- Hebbian mechanics active: +0.5 activation per retrieval, co-occurrence wiring, daily 0.95 decay
- Removed standalone graph-memory plugin (replaced by integrated facts search)

### FileIndexer (QMD Replacement)
- Built `storage/file-indexer.js` in continuity plugin
- 210 files, 732 chunks, 768d nomic embeddings via localhost:8082
- Incremental re-index via mtime, cron every 5 min
- Results injected as "From your documents:" in context

### facts.db Hygiene
- Cleaned 4 junk values, 23 semantic dupes, pruned 222 cold facts
- Insert-time guards: semantic dedup (80% word overlap), junk filter, 500-fact cap
- Stable categories (person, pet, preference) exempt from decay
- Relations table: 36 subject/predicate/object triples for family, friends, pets

### active-context.md Cleanup
- 156 lines → 22 lines (P1 cap at 25, insert-time dedup)

## 2026-02-20 — llama.cpp Embedding Backend + Telemetry

### plugin-continuity (forked from CoderofTheWest/openclaw-plugin-continuity)
- **BREAKING**: Replaced ONNX embedding (MiniLM-L6-v2, 384d) with llama.cpp GPU backend (nomic-embed-text-v1.5, 768d)
- ONNX retained as fallback if llama.cpp server is unavailable
- Fixed init order: embeddings initialize before table creation (prevents dimension mismatch)
- Auto-detects dimension changes and recreates vector table
- Added search telemetry logging to `/tmp/openclaw/memory-telemetry.jsonl`
- Default dimensions changed from 384 → 768
- Performance: 6.5ms avg search (was ~240ms), 12s full re-index (was ~6.5min)

### plugin-graph-memory
- Added search telemetry logging (latency, result count, entity matches, FTS hits)
- Added timing instrumentation on graph search

### scripts/memory-telemetry.js (NEW)
- `report` — aggregate stats by system (p50/p95 latency, hit rates, injection rates)
- `benchmark` — 10 golden queries across both systems (currently scoring 100%)
- `tail` — live telemetry watch

### Infrastructure
- New Docker container: `llama-embed` (llama.cpp + nomic-embed-text-v1.5-f16.gguf on ROCm GPU)
- Managed via Komodo stack on port 8082

## 2026-02-20 — plugins.allow Fix, Graph Telemetry Debug, Documentation

### Bug Fix
- **plugins.allow was blocking graph-memory** — the allowlist set on Feb 17 didn't include `graph-memory`, so the plugin never loaded despite being `enabled: true`. No errors were logged — it was completely silent. Fixed by adding `graph-memory` to allow list.

### plugin-graph-memory
- Added telemetry for ALL exit paths: too-short queries, no-entity-match, empty results, errors
- Debug logging for `_stripContextBlocks` behavior

### plugin-continuity
- Added QMD/BM25 telemetry via `tool_result_persist` hook

### Documentation
- Added `plugins.allow` gotcha with handler count verification method
- Updated continuity plugin section: llama.cpp GPU embeddings (768d), 60x faster
- Added Search Telemetry section with report/benchmark/tail usage
- Updated embedding options table with llama.cpp + latency comparison
- Added llama.cpp embedding server Docker setup guide
- Added nomic-embed-text task prefix documentation
